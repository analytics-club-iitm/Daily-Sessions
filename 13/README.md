# K-Nearest Neighbours

Hey everyone, so today we will be trying to understand how KNN works and how to implement a simple KNN Model from scratch.

- Implementing from scratch [link](knn_analytics.ipynb)

# Task 

So in the code along we have implemented KNN for classification. Try varying the parameter K and determine for which value the accuracy is the most.
